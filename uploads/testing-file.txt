Hey, This is one of the testing files I will create for my internship.
Therefore this document is random bible quotes I like:

Psalms 23: 1-3

1  The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.
2     He makes me lie down in green pastures,
   he leads me beside quiet waters,
3     he refreshes my soul.
   He guides me along the right paths
      for his nameâ€™s sake.
4 Even though I walk
    through the darkest valley,[a]
  I will fear no evil,
    for you are with me;
  your rod and your staff,
    they comfort me.
